Literals: A bare literal value (examples: \"42\", \"Hugo\") is a value to be matched against. It searches over the full text of the document and the searchable properties. Logical operators: \"AND\", \"and\", \"OR\", and \"or\" are binary logical operators (example: \"engineer OR developer\"). Negation operators: \"NOT\" and \"!\" are negation operators (example: \"NOT software\"). Comparison operators: support the binary comparison operators =, !=, <, >, <= and >= for string, numeric, enum, boolean. Also support like operator `~~` for string. It provides semantic search functionality by parsing, stemming and doing synonyms expansion against the input query. To specify a property in the query, the left hand side expression in the comparison must be the property ID including the parent. The right hand side must be literals. For example: \"\\\"projects/123/locations/us\\\".property_a < 1\" matches results whose \"property_a\" is less than 1 in project 123 and us location. The literals and comparison expression can be connected in a single query (example: \"software engineer \\\"projects/123/locations/us\\\".salary > 100\"). Functions: supported functions are `LOWER([property_name])` to perform a case insensitive match and `EMPTY([property_name])` to filter on the existence of a key. Support nested expressions connected using parenthesis and logical operators. The default logical operators is `AND` if there is no operators between expressions.

This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
